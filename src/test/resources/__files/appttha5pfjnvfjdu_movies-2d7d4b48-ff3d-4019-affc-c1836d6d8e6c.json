It was written by Nora and Delia Ephron based on the 1937 play Parfumerie by MiklÃ³s LÃ¡szlÃ³. The film is about two e-mailing lovers who are completely unaware that their sweetheart is, in fact, a person with whom they share a degree of animosity. An adaptation of Parfumerie was previously made as The Shop Around the Corner, a 1940 film by Ernst Lubitsch and also a 1949 musical remake, In the Good Old Summertime by Robert Z. Leonard starring Judy Garland. You've Got Mail updates that concept with the use of e-mail. Influences from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly â€” a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet in the film. Ephron stated that You've Got Mail was as much about the Upper West Side itself as the characters, highlighting the \"small town community\" feel that pervades the Upper West Side.","Photos":[{"id":"attJB6oqbGP1R29Mh","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/i7JySJuDSpq7V7po3iH7_You've_Got_Mail.jpg","filename":"You've_Got_Mail.jpg","size":30719,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/qV5Hxms7Qti9caXU0XXo_small_You've_Got_Mail.jpg","width":25,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/5VRuAWpeRpWqIy10nb26_large_You've_Got_Mail.jpg","width":270,"height":396}}}],"Actors":["recyvYGW0CLB5FANL","recNs5E54KQzgPvOG"],"Director":["recBCuNMX4gs7USwu"],"Genre":["Romantic Comedy"],"Personal Notes":"I can't imagine this movie has aged well..."},"createdTime":"2014-07-18T04:52:02.000Z"}]}
